**[IMPORTANT (2022/11/03)]**

After receving reports of erroneous  data, we have fixed and reuploaded a majority of SoccerTrack. We are also adding videos with visualized bounding boxes so that you can be sure that the data is good. The visualizations can be found in the viz_results directory under Top-view/Wide-view (see [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atomscott/soccertrack)).

However, there is still work to do. In the meantime, we have created a spreadsheet to keep everyone updated on our progress.

All data in SoccerTrack was obtained from 11-vs-11 soccer games between college-aged athletes. Measurements were conducted after we received the approval of Tsukuba universityâ€™s ethics committee, and all participants provided signed informed permission. After recording several soccer matches, the videos were semi-automatically annotated based on the GNSS coordinates of each player.

Below are low resolution samples from the soccertrack dataset we plan to release. The actual dataset will contains (drone) and 8K (fisheye) footage!
