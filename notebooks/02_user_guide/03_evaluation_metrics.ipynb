    "Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is notoriously difficult to evaluate accurately. While commonly used metrics such as MOTA tend to overemphasize accurate detection, IDF1 and AssA tend to overemphasize association quality. Consequently, since its proposal, Higher-Order Tracking Accuracy (HOTA) has been adopted as the primary metric in several recent benchmarks (BDD100K, KITTI, DanceTrack). HOTA seeks to balance detection and association by combining a DetA and an AssA."
