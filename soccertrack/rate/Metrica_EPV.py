Module for exploring expected possession value (EPV) surfaces using MetricaSports's tracking & event data.

EPV is the probability that a possession will end with a goal given the current location of the ball. Multiplying by a
pitch control surface gives the expected value of moving the ball to any location, accounting for the probability that the 
ball move (pass/carry) is successful.

The EPV surface is saved in the FoT github repo and can be loaded using load_EPV_grid()

A detailed description of EPV can be found in the accompanying video tutorial here:

Main Functions
----------

load_EPV_grid(): load pregenerated EPV surface from file. 
calculate_epv_added(): Calculates the expected possession value added by a pass
find_max_value_added_target(): Finds the *maximum* expected possession value that could have been achieved for a pass (defined by the event_id) by searching the entire field for the best target.
